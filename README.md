Client Deployment Using PowerShell
Automate the deployment and configuration of RustDesk clients with this PowerShell-based solution. This script is ideal for environments requiring remote access management with custom server configurations and fallback mechanisms.

ðŸŽ¯ Features
Automated Installation: Downloads and installs the latest RustDesk client silently.

Custom Configuration: Prepares the client to connect to your own rendezvous and relay servers.

Predefined Passwords: Automatically sets a secure password for remote access.

Version Control: Skips reinstallation if the desired version is already installed.

Fallback Mechanism: Includes a silentlycontinu.cmd file to ensure compatibility with environments where PowerShell scripts cannot be executed directly.

Detailed Logs: Generates log files for tracking the installation process.

ðŸš€ How It Works
Version Check: Determines if the installed version matches the desired version (1.3.7). If it does, the script exits to avoid redundant installations.

Silent Installation: Downloads and installs RustDesk in the background if an update is required.

Server Configuration: Configures the client to use your custom rendezvous and relay servers.

Password Setup: Automatically applies a predefined secure password for remote connections.

Fallback Support: Copies the included silentlycontinu.cmd file to the %temp% directory and executes it if .ps1 files are restricted.

ðŸ“„ Included Files
rustdesk_deployment.ps1: The main PowerShell script for automating installation and configuration.

silentlycontinu.cmd: A fallback CMD file to ensure execution in restricted environments.

ðŸ“‹ Requirements
Windows with PowerShell 5.1 or higher.

Administrator privileges.

Internet access to download the RustDesk installer.

Access to custom rendezvous and relay servers.
