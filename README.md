Client Deployment Using PowerShell
Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I wanted to share a PowerShell script I developed for automating the deployment and configuration of RustDesk clients. This script is particularly useful for environments where you need to manage remote access efficiently and with custom server configurations.

ðŸŽ¯ Features:
Automated Installation: Downloads and installs the latest RustDesk client silently.
Custom Configuration: Automatically configures rendezvous and relay servers.
Predefined Settings: Sets a custom password for secure remote access.
Version Control: Verifies if the latest version is installed before proceeding with updates.

ðŸš€ How It Works:
Version Check: The script first checks if the installed version matches the desired one (1.3.7). If it does, the script exits to avoid unnecessary reinstallation.
Silent Installation: If the version differs, it downloads and installs RustDesk in the background.
Custom Server Setup: Configures the rendezvous and relay servers to match your infrastructure.
Password Definition: Sets a secure password for remote sessions.
Logging: Outputs logs to C:\Temp\rustdesk_install.log for easy troubleshooting.

ðŸ’» Requirements:
PowerShell 5.1 or higher.
Administrator privileges.
Access to your custom RustDesk servers.
